#Compare the functions of the device in the past to the functions of the device now.

In past, work of a watch was only to show time nothing else then after some time
some watches also started showing day and month but nowadays a Fitbit can perform many functions 
like it can count our steps (distance covered in a day by footsteps) and keeping record of our heartbeats for our safety of our health.

#For your chosen IoT device, list any improvements or any diminishments if they exist, over the non-IOT device.
Describe any limitations that are present in the new IoT version of the device.

1) Accuracy in steps counting and distance accuracy
2) Calibrate exercise detection 
3) Improve sleep tracking accuracy.


#Describe any privacy issues with the IoT device that never existed in the original version of the device.
Compare the price of the original device to the price of the new IoT version of the device.

Previously there was no security issue because there was no data collected through our simple watch,but nowadays all our data which 
is recorded in Fitbit it can be selled to third party and our Privacy can come at Risk.
In case of price, we can buy a simple watch for just Rs. 500 or less than that but if we have to buy a FitBit minimum Rs 3000 is
required.
It's also because it provides us many different functions which are not present in a simple watch.
