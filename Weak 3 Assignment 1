#Research two microcontrollers and provide information about them from their datasheets. 
There are several microcontroller manufacturers that you can investigate including Atmel, Microchip, Freescale, TI, etc.
For each microcontroller, report the following information. (Be sure to include a link to an online reference where you
found this information.)  

Clock frequency
